## Core Features
- Monitor any Binance spot pair (BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, etc.)
- Up alerts: 1-min candle High >= strike price
- Down alerts: 1-min candle Low <= strike price
- Per-alert notes shown when strike is hit
- No historical backfill—only candles from bot startup onward

## Tech Stack

- discord.py (Discord bot)
- python-binance (Binance API)
- Render (Background Worker)

## Data Flow
1. Bot fetches latest closed 1-min candle every ~60 seconds
2. Compares candle High/Low to configured strike prices
3. Sends Discord embed with ticker, strike, note on hit
